## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

The project requires Python 3.8 and above. You can check your Python version with the following command:

```bash
python --version
```

The project also requires several Python packages. You can install them with the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Installation

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
```

Next, navigate to the project folder:

```bash
cd your-repo-name
```

Then, set up a Python virtual environment to manage your project's dependencies. First, create the virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv myenv
```

Next, activate the virtual environment:

- For bash/zsh:

```bash
source myenv/bin/activate
```

- For fish:

```fish
source myenv/bin/activate.fish
```

After activating the virtual environment, install the project's dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Project

With the virtual environment activated and all dependencies installed, you can now run your project with:

```bash
python main.py
```

Remember to replace `main.py` with the actual name of your Python script.
